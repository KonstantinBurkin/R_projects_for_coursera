# Fine particulate matter pollution

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it says about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year.

## In this assignment I answered the following questions:

-   Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
-   Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008?
-   Which of the four types of sources have decreased in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have increased in emissions from 1999–2008?
-   Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
-   How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
-   Is there any difference in emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City and in emissions from motor vehicles in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
