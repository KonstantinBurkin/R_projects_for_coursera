# R projects for coursera
This repo contains several projects that I submitted for Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University. This series of courses is available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). They cover the concepts and tools for the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results.

## This Specialization includes 10 courses:
- The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
- R Programming
- Getting and Cleaning Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Reproducible Research
- Statistical Inference
- Regression Models
- Practical Machine Learning
- Developing Data Products
- Data Science Capstone

Most of the courses require a mini project as the final assignment. Here I place the completed assignments.
